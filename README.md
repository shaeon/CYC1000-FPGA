We'll use main a Paco and Jaime design board that left you connect keyboard and mouse ps/2, one db9 for joystick, HDMI, and a connector for rpi zero or banana m2 zero.

Also we use a small board with vga and ps/2 for testing.

In some cores we use a external clock, 50Mhz, so check read.me in each project if it isn't work.
